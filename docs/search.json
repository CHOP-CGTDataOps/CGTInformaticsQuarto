    "text": "We’re thrilled to announce the release of REDCapTidieR v0.2.0 on CRAN. REDCapTidieR provides an elegant way to import data from a REDCap database into an R environment.\nREDCapTidieR is led by a primary function, read_redcap_tidy, built on top of the streamlined API extraction processes provided by the REDCapR package. read_redcap_tidy does all the laborious work of taking complex REDCap databases and transforming them into manageable, tidy tables for easier processing with less start up time for analysts. The output provided is referred to as the supertibble, since the REDCap data is provided in a “tibble of tibbles”. In a supertibble output, each row represents a REDCap form/instrument containing a list column of the associated tibble."

    "text": "New read_redcap_tidy Arguments\nTo enhance and expand the capabilities of read_redcap_tidy, we’ve introduced two new arguments to pass to the API:\n\nforms\nexport_survey_fields\n\nYou can now call specific forms from your database instead of defaulting to downloading the entire dataset. This can be especially useful for very large databases where full data downloads take up needless memory.\n<—- ADD SAMPLE OUTPUT OF FORMS SPEC FROM CLASSIC DB HERE —->\n\nSupport for Survey Fields\nWe have also included default survey fields from the API:\n\n[instrument_name]_timestamp\nredcap_survey_identifier\n\nBy default, these will appear for survey projects but can be turned off if desired by setting export_survey_fields to FALSE. Please refer to the REDCap documentation regarding behavior of these fields, especially survey identifiers as they require databases to be set up in special ways.\n<—- ADD SAMPLE SURVEY OUTPUT FROM CLASSIC DB HERE —->"
