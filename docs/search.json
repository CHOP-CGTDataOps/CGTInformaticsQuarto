    "text": "New names for functions\nWe have decided to rename some of the exported functions of our package. Here is what changed:\n\nread_redcap_tidy() is now read_redcap()\nbind_tables() is now bind_tibbles()\nextract_table() is now extract_tibble()\nextract_tables() is now extract_tibbles()\n\nWe have also cleaned up the API to make the function arguments more consistent.\nWe are handling each of these name changes with deprecation functions of the lifecycle package. This means that you can still use the original function names, but you will receive an annoying alert to switch to the new ones each time you try to use them. At some point in the future we may remove the deprecated functions from the package.\n\nWhy on earth would you do that?!\nWe want to design our API so it’s easy to learn and use.\nThe main function of the package is read_redcap(), and its name explains exactly what it does: it reads or imports data from REDCap. The fact that the object that this function returns (i.e. the supertibble) is tidy is a technical detail.\nWe replaced “table” with “tibble” in the data tibble extraction functions because “tibble” is a more precise term than “table.” Also, this way we are being more consistent in our use of REDCapTidieR vocabulary such as “supertibble” and “data tibble”.\nWe also thought about the names in terms of teachability. When you explain how to use the package to someone for the first time, how would you describe the action of each of the functions? For example, how do you read data from REDCap? With read_redcap(). How do you extract a data tibble from the supertibble? With extract_tibble(). Or if you’d rather bind the tibbles to your environment, use bind_tibbles().\n\n\nWhy now?\nREDCapTidieR is still very new and there doesn’t yet exist much code that depends on it (we hope this will change!). The cost of fixing things is low now compared to later on."

Variable labels are awesome and we think you will find them useful! Take a look at Shannon Pileggi’s blog post The case for variable labels in R to find out more.\nREDCapTidieR now provides make_labelled(), a function that attaches variable labels to the supertibble and the tibbles it contains:\n\nsuperheroes_labelled <- superheroes |>\n  make_labelled()\n\nIn the RStudio Data Viewer, variable labels appear below each column name. This makes it easy to inspect the contents of the supertibble:\n\nWhile the variable labels in the supertibble are static and pre-defined, variable labels in the data tibbles (redcap_data) are derived from the REDCap field labels. A field label is a piece of text that prompts the REDCap user during data entry. We repurpose field labels to provide a description for the variable:"
