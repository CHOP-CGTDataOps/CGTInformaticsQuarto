Here is what changed:\n\nread_redcap_tidy() is now read_redcap()\nbind_tables() is now bind_tibbles()\nextract_table() is now extract_tibble()\nextract_tables() is now extract_tibbles()\n\nWe have also cleaned up the API to make the function arguments more consistent.\nWe are handling each of these name changes with deprecation functions of the lifecycle package. This means that you can still use the original function names, but you will receive an annoying alert to switch to the new ones each time you try to use them. At some point in the future we may remove the deprecated functions from the package.\n\nWhy on earth would you do that?!\nWe want to design our API so it‚Äôs easy to learn and use.\nThe main function of the package is read_redcap(), and its name explains exactly what it does: it reads or imports data from REDCap. The fact that the object that this function returns (i.e.¬†the supertibble) is tidy is a technical detail.\nWe replaced ‚Äútable‚Äù with ‚Äútibble‚Äù in the data tibble extraction functions because ‚Äútibble‚Äù is a more precise term than ‚Äútable.‚Äù Also, this way we are being more consistent in our use of REDCapTidieR vocabulary such as ‚Äúsupertibble‚Äù and ‚Äúdata tibble‚Äù.\nWe also thought about the names in terms of teachability. When you explain how to use the package to someone for the first time, how would you describe the action of each of the functions? For example, how do you read data from REDCap? With read_redcap(). How do you extract a data tibble from the supertibble? With extract_tibble(). Or if you‚Äôd rather bind the tibbles to your environment, use bind_tibbles().\n\n\nWhy now?\nREDCapTidieR is still very new and there doesn‚Äôt yet exist much code that depends on it (we hope this will change!). The cost of fixing things is low now compared to later on."

    "text": "Major Update: Repeating Events Support! üéâ\nREDCapTidieR introduces support for REDCap ‚Äúrepeating events,‚Äù enhancing its versatility in handling diverse data collection scenarios. A repeating event is a feature in REDCap that is often utilized in clinical trials for unscheduled study visits. It allows for the collection of the same data zero, one, or multiple times within a longitudinal project alongside regular scheduled study visit events. This feature enables researchers to efficiently gather data from the same set of instruments during various unscheduled time points or instances, while maintaining an organized data structure. With this update, users of longitudinal databases can now take full advantage of this feature, simplifying data import and analysis in R.\nFor example, consider the physical_exam table which contains data from both regular scheduled and unscheduled visits. These unscheduled visits occur under a single REDCap repeating event. Notice how subject_id 001-123-001 has data for both the ‚Äúscreening_enrollm‚Äù and ‚Äúunscheduled‚Äù redcap_events. This demonstrates that you can work with data from both regular scheduled study visits and unscheduled visits in the same data tibble. Also note that the redcap_event_instance values identify the specific unscheduled event that the row is about. This makes it possible to link data in different data tibbles from the same unscheduled event.\n\nlibrary(REDCapTidieR)\n\nread_redcap(redcap_uri, token) |> \n  bind_tibbles()\n\nphysical_exam |> \n  filter(redcap_event == \"screening__enrollm\" | redcap_event == \"unscheduled\") |> \n  rmarkdown::paged_table()\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nTo support repeating events fully we updated the way REDCapTidieR creates identifier columns for a data tibble (see table below). A breaking change in version 0.3.0 is that we removed the redcap_repeat_instance and replaced it with redcap_form_instance for repeated instruments and redcap_event_instance for repeated events. If you explicitly refer to redcap_repeat_instance anywhere in your code you will update this to redcap_form_instance. Please note that REDCap does not allow having repeating instruments inside a repeating event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstrument Structure\nEvent Structure\nClassic\nLongitudinal, one arm\nLongitudinal, multi-arm\n\n\n\n\nNonrepeating\nNonrepeating\nrecord_id\nrecord_id +\nredcap_event\nrecord_id +\nredcap_event +\nredcap_arm\n\n\nRepeating\nNonrepeating\nrecord_id +\nredcap_form_instance\nrecord_id +\nredcap_form_instance +\nredcap_event\nrecord_id +\nredcap_form_instance +\nredcap_event +\nredcap_arm\n\n\nNonrepeating\nRepeating\nN/A\nrecord_id +\nredcap_event_instance +\nredcap_event\nrecord_id +\nredcap_event_instance +\nredcap_event +\nredcap_arm\n\n\nRepeating\nRepeating\nNot Supported\nNot Supported\nNot Supported"
