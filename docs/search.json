    "section": "Naming Things is Hard!",
    "text": "Naming Things is Hard!\nBefore we get too deep into all of the exciting new features and expanded capabilities of the package, we need to address the rework of REDCapTidieR’s function names. As described in R Packages, naming packages and their components can prove to be the most difficult part of package creation! Trust us when we say we’ve spent a good length of time volleying every possible convention for both REDCapTidieR and each of its functions before landing on what we’ve chosen today.\n\nFunction Changes and Handling\nBelow is quick list of the changes:\n\nread_redcap_tidy is now read_redcap\nbind_tables is now bind_tibbles\nextract_table is now extract_tibble\nextract_tables is now extract_tibbles\n\nEach of these will be handled with a soft deprecation, leading up to a removal of the original function names in a future version release. You can still use the original names, but you will receive an alert to switch to the new ones.\n\n\nRationale\nWhen it came to chopping off the “tidy” portion of read_redcap(), we thought about what the best course would be for teachability. When working with REDCap and R, you will find users who come to one solely having experience in the other. Some users will find R when looking for tools to analyze their REDCap database, others will be R aficionados thrown into REDCap analysis for the first time. Therefore, succinct names that describe directives are important. read_redcap() is evocative, and aligns well with tidyverse styled functions such as those in the readr package.\nAs we worked on writing up the extensive documentation for REDCapTidieR’s pkgdown site, we wanted to really lean into “branding.” The major output of a read_redcap() call is a special object containing data and metadata in neatly organized tidy tibbles which we have opted to call the “supertibble.” Since this is essential to the DNA of the package, we chose to swap out the generic “table” names with “tibble” to align with the supertibble and serve as a more informative descriptor for what users can expect to get out of these functions."

This makes it easy to inspect the contents of the supertibble:\n\nWhile the variable labels in the supertibble are pre-defined, variable labels in the data tibbles (in redcap_data) are derived from the REDCap field labels. This way, field labels seen in REDCap during data entry are repurposed as variable descriptions:"
