We're a bit overdue, but delighted to announce that the v1.0.0 version of [REDCapTidieR](https://chop-cgtinformatics.github.io/REDCapTidieR/) has been released to CRAN! Additionally, we have officially published our first paper in **The Journal of Open Source Software** (JOSS) under ["REDCapTideR: Extracting complex REDCap databases into tidy tables"](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.06277).

You can install the package from CRAN with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("REDCapTidieR")
```

## Development Journey

The humble beginnings of REDCapTidieR started with a single request to compile multiple REDCap projects for clinical trials into an analytic visualization tool. It became quickly apparent after working with the first couple of longitudinal databases that we were repeating the same operations to tackle REDCap's standard, notorious [block matrix](https://chop-cgtinformatics.github.io/REDCapTidieR/articles/glossary.html#block-matrix) and that no real solutions existed in the open source R community for handling complex REDCap databases that suited our needs.

To write the package, some core decisions had to be made up front. As a team rooted in [tidy](https://chop-cgtinformatics.github.io/REDCapTidieR/articles/glossary.html#tidy) data principles, we wanted to ensure that outputs from our package corresponded with definitions for tidy rectangular data structures. Since the [block matrix](https://chop-cgtinformatics.github.io/REDCapTidieR/articles/glossary.html#block-matrix) fundamentally obscures [granularity](https://chop-cgtinformatics.github.io/REDCapTidieR/articles/glossary.html#granularity) in projects containing [repeating events](https://chop-cgtinformatics.github.io/REDCapTidieR/articles/glossary.html#repeating-event) and [repeating instruments](https://chop-cgtinformatics.github.io/REDCapTidieR/articles/glossary.html#repeating-instrument), it was important to identify the [composite primary key](https://chop-cgtinformatics.github.io/REDCapTidieR/articles/glossary.html#composite-primary-key)s that defined tables of varying project structures and isolate them from the block matrix while keeping them easily joinable.

We wanted a way to not only break out instruments into tidy tables, but also to house them under an easy-to-use structure. Thus the [supertibble](https://chop-cgtinformatics.github.io/REDCapTidieR/articles/glossary.html#supertibble) was born to leverage the accessibility of [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/)'s elegant dataframes with the flexibility of nested list elements. This gave us even more room to grow by providing metadata to our users for quick exploratory data analysis of their projects.

Once the core concept was ironed out, REDCapTidieR was further adapted to give users more tools to work with their exported databases, including [labelling their data with the `labelled` package](https://chop-cgtinformatics.github.io/REDCapTidieR/articles/REDCapTidieR.html#adding-variable-labels-with-the-labelled-package), [exporting their data to Excel with `openxlsx2`](https://chop-cgtinformatics.github.io/REDCapTidieR/articles/export_to_xlsx.html), and getting [summary statistics with `skimr`](https://chop-cgtinformatics.github.io/REDCapTidieR/articles/REDCapTidieR.html#adding-summary-statistics-to-the-metadata-with-the-skimr-package).

## JOSS Publication

REDCapTidieR has become a useful tool to many analysts working in REDCap and R, and to showcase our commitment to the package and its development we published ["REDCapTideR: Extracting complex REDCap databases into tidy tables"](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.06277) in The Journal of Open Source Software. This technical paper will provide you with even greater detail to our design decisions and the ways in which REDCapTidieR fills a unique role in the research space.

## Acknolwedgements

REDCapTidieR is the first open source package our team has made available to the community. To date, we are in awe that we have surpassed over **five thousands downloads** and see that number grow every day. The success of it wouldn't be possible without the support and collaboration of the those who helped with its development, opened issues, and contributed to discussions: [@camcaan](https://github.com/camcaan), [@JanMarvin](https://github.com/JanMarvin), [@matthieu-faron](https://github.com/matthieu-faron), [@olivroy](https://github.com/olivroy), [@pwildenhain](https://github.com/pwildenhain), [@tschuler](https://github.com/tschuler), [@wibeasley](https://github.com/wibeasley).

## Next Steps

We aren't done developing REDCapTidieR, and have some ideas in store for the next releases of it including:

- Codebook support
- Allowance for instruments that are both repeating and non-repeating
- Additional functions for extracting REDCap project information

Have a feature you want to see? Please [open an issue](https://github.com/CHOP-CGTInformatics/REDCapTidieR/issues) and let us know how we can continue making this package even better!
