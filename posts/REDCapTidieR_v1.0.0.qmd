We're delighted to announce that [REDCapTidieR](https://chop-cgtinformatics.github.io/REDCapTidieR/) has earned v1.0.0 status on CRAN! REDCapTidieR provides a user-friendly way to [import](https://chop-cgtinformatics.github.io/REDCapTidieR/articles/glossary.html#import) data from a [REDCap](https://www.project-redcap.org/) [project](https://chop-cgtinformatics.github.io/REDCapTidieR/articles/glossary.html#project) into the R environment.

You can install the package from CRAN with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("REDCapTidieR")
```

It's hard to believe, but REDCapTidieR has been in development for over a year since the CGT Informatics team began working on it in July of 2022. During that time, the package has taken on a number of changes, feature considerations, and optimizations that we believe make this package worthy of being considered stable (ðŸŽ‰).

While there are no new features to announce, this post will take the opportunity to walk down memory lane and review the road map that got us to where we are today.

> things to review

- performance improvements
- JOSS paper acceptance?

## The Early Beginnings

As with most packages, the impetus for creating REDCapTidieR started with frustration in a project. At the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, the [CGT Informatics team](https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/cell-and-gene-therapy-informatics-team) supports a number of [REDCap](https://www.project-redcap.org/) databases responsible for clinical trial data by providing applications, dashboards, and reports. It became clear after the first few interactions with these longitudinal databases, that we were quickly repeating mundane operations to tidy up the data outputs of REDCap into usable formats for visualization and reporting.

As avid R users and subscribers to "[tidy data](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10)," we quickly realized how unwieldy the standard REDCap [block matrix](https://chop-cgtinformatics.github.io/REDCapTidieR/articles/diving_deeper.html#the-block-matrix) output was and that there was an opportunity to standardize it into a format that aligns with tidy data principles. After assessing the landscape of [REDCap tools](https://redcap-tools.github.io/projects/) available for programmatic interaction, we found that there wasn't a truly tidy framework in R that could support reformatting the block matrix, and so we got to work at designing our own.

## Extensions and Additional Features

The user interface of REDCapTidieR has always been at the forefront of our design considerations and we make certain to ensure it is easy to use, easy to navigate, and suits most common needs. You wouldn't believe the lengthy discussions had over the name of the package, the names of the core functions, and then the names of the updated core functions when we realized [we didn't like the ones we chose anymore](https://chop-cgtinformatics.github.io/CGTInformaticsQuarto/posts/REDCapTidieR_v0.2.html#why-on-earth-would-you-do-that). Once we felt REDCapTidieR's core functionality was working, we expanded its capabilities.

First we gave it the ability to [support variable labels](https://chop-cgtinformatics.github.io/REDCapTidieR/articles/REDCapTidieR.html#adding-variable-labels-with-the-labelled-package) using the [labelled](https://larmarange.github.io/labelled/) package, making it easier to view data in a more readable way using a simple call to `REDCapTidieR::make_labelled()`.

We further extended it by introducing the `write_redcap_xlsx()` function, letting users tap into the [openxlsx2](https://janmarvin.github.io/openxlsx2/) package and convert their data tibbles into XLSX sheets. 

## Acknolwedgements

REDCapTidieR is the first open source package our team has made available to the community. The success of it wouldn't be possible without the support and collaboration of the those who helped with its development, opened issues, or contributed to discussions: [@camcaan](https://github.com/camcaan), [@JanMarvin](https://github.com/JanMarvin), [@matthieu-faron](https://github.com/matthieu-faron), [@olivroy](https://github.com/olivroy), [@pwildenhain](https://github.com/pwildenhain), [@tschuler](https://github.com/tschuler), [@wibeasley](https://github.com/wibeasley).

## Miscellaneous

-   Updated any functions that relied on `openxlsx2` to use the newest stable functions of its 1.0 release
-   Internal package cleaning and consolidation
-   Updates to the `pkgdown` site
